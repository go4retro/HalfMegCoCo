# HalfMegCoCo - a DRAM-based 512kB DRAM Expansion for the TANDY Color Computer 3
These printed circuit boards implement a very simplistic DRAM-based memory expansion for the Color Computer 3.  They use either 44256 256kb x 4 DRAM ICs in eitehr DIP or "ZIP" format.  

## Issues
* I have not extensively tested the DIP version, but it appears to work and runs the stress12 test with flying colors
* The ZIP schematic does not appear to work, or at least I was not able to get it to work.  I have PCBs if someone wants to try to fix.
